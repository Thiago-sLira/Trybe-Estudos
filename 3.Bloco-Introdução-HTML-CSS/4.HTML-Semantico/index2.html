            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things—detect light, and
                convert it
                into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of ways. There are single and compound eyes,
                bifocal
                lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and optic fibres.Just for information, it's scientific name
                <em>Odontodactylus scyllarus</em>. And there are eyes that are so alien, so constantly
                surprising, that after decades of research, scientists have only just about figured out how they work,
                let
                alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a swim.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>This is the eye of a mantis shrimp—an marine animal that’s neither a mantis nor a shrimp, but a close
                relative of crabs and lobsters. It’s a compound eye, made of thousands of small units that each detects
                light independently. Those in the midband—the central stripe you can see in the photo—are special.
                They’re
                the ones that let the animal see colour.</p>
